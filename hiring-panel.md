## Q&A
### How did you get your current job?
* Maggie: Did everything. Was an executive assistant, then in HR, then working with clients, then liked doing web design projects so I did web design (took some classes at GA). Stay curious. Have taken 4 part time courses at GA.  

* Paul: Fell into it. About being curious. Make your own niche and develop that for yourself. These jobs aren't always listed. You get a lot of advantage working at small companies that may not have the answers but are excited for solutions. 
  * At they CSIS, wanted to be more technological. Started as a journalist, and that was enough to give some information for the public: data visualization, interactives, etc  

* Matt: Worked in comms for 10 years. Was switching jobs every 1-2 years. Looked into web development. Liked it. Did a bootcamp. Got a job immediately.  

### What makes an applicant stand out?
* Paul: look at the resume last. Is the least significant part. Portfolio website is the first thing. Followed by github. Quality of work is the most important and what they've been able to produce in the past.  

* Maggie: Want portfolio pieces to look nice. That's important. Design is important.
  * Cover letters don't matter as much. BUT it should tell a narrative. I need to know that you can communicate well.  

* Matt: Don't want to open the console and see red errors down the console. Resume is a very non-tech job. More focused on github and portfolio website. Coming from a Comms background, packaging yourself is critical. Make it easy for someone to look at your skill set and understand a narrative. Market yourself. 
  * Make sure your stuff works
  * My first application was to an agency. They told me that one of my projects was the same as everyone.  

### How many projects would you say give you a sense of a person's work?
* Paul: practicality is super important. I want to see something that has a practical use and application
  * Quality over quantity
  * Practical is better than experimental

* Matt: Give some context on why you built it and what technologies you used. 
  * After applying and before your interview, try to teach yourself something that you saw on the requirements but didn't know
  * Before interviewing at Hatch, I saw that they had scroll magic on their homepage, so I put that on my portfolio and was able to talk about it at the interview. 

### What matters more on portfolio projects: code quality vs functionality?
* Matt: Write a good readme. Tell me installation instructions. Make it easy for me to understand. 

* Paul: Make it work. So many portfolio websites fail.

### What do you look at first?
* Matt: I look at the projects and then I look at the code

### What are you thoughts on imposter syndrome?
* Maggie: Try to be human. The more you get comfortable talking about yourself, selling yourself, the better you will feel.

* Paul: DC needs more tech people. There's a chance to shape where companies go. 

### How can candidates make themselves better?
1. Always thank. Send a follow-up
2. If they decline, you can try asking for feedback on your code or your technical work or your portfolio. Frame it very specifically. Make it very nice. Talk about self growth, etc. 

### What questions should we be asking during the interview? Either ones that you liked asking when you last applied for a job. Or one that you've been asked that seemed wise.
1. What direction is the company going in?
2. What technologies is the company interested in?
3. What are the values of the company and role of that in day to day?
4. Questions related to the research on the company you did: tech, policies, etc. 
5. Questions that show curiosity or inquisitiveness related to a project, etc.

### Worst and Best advice:
* Matt: Worst was not to do the bootcamp. Best was to "say no to offers. Don't say no to opportunities"
* Paul: I hate working with recruiters. Know yourself and what you want to do and don't rely on someone else to do that.
* Maggie: Stay hungry, keep learning.
